# Project Overview

This repository is derived from a larger VR-based consumer behavior study.
The original project includes a full Unity VR environment, headset data
collection, behavioral feature extraction, and downstream analysis.

This GitHub repository focuses on documenting and demonstrating
the **data processing and analysis pipeline**, rather than the VR application itself.

## Original Project Components

### VR Environment
- Implemented in Unity
- Full VR experience packaged as:
  `Food_U2022-2-6f1-Jiaxin_20Jan2024`
- Used for collecting behavioral and eye-tracking data
- The Unity project is not included in this repository

### Raw Data Sources
- Headset and controller data (position, rotation, distance)
- Eye-tracking data
- Interaction and behavior logs
- Participant metadata and experimental conditions

## Data Organization (Original Project)

- `overall_otherdata/`  
  Contains behavioral data collected from headset and controllers

- `overall_eyetracking/`  
  Contains raw eye-tracking data from participants

## Data Processing & Analysis Pipeline

### Feature Extraction
- `core_function.py`  
  Core functions for extracting eye-tracking features

- `child_function.py`  
  Helper functions supporting core feature extraction logic

- `headset_data.py`  
  Behavioral feature calculation based on headset and controller data  
  (e.g. rotation, distance, movement features)

### Data Integration
- `analysis.py`  
  Main script for extracting eye-tracking features and exporting
  analysis-ready CSV files

- `main_df.py`  
  Integrates behavioral and eye-tracking features into a unified table

### Outputs
- `eyetracking_df.csv`  
  Eye-tracking feature table

- `eye_beh_choice_FN_df.csv`  
  Combined dataset including:
  - Behavioral features
  - Eye-tracking features
  - Food neophobia levels
  - Participant food choices

### Downstream Analysis
- `machine_learning.py`  
  Machine learning training based on extracted features

- `FN_statistics.py`  
  Statistical analysis and visualization of food neophobia levels

## Notes
All data shown in this repository is either synthetic, anonymized,
or described at a conceptual level.

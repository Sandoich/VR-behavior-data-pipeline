# VR Behavior Data Pipeline

This repository presents a simplified data processing workflow
designed for VR-based behavioral experiments.

## Background
The project is inspired by my work on VR consumer behavior research,
where participant sessions included multiple data sources such as
eye-tracking logs, interaction events, and metadata collected separately.

## What I did
- Designed a structured data schema for multi-source VR experiment data
- Built Python-based logic to reconstruct participant timelines
- Validated and cleaned behavioral logs for analysis readiness
- Focused on reproducible and transparent data workflows

## Skills & Technologies
- Python
- Behavioral & eye-tracking data
- Data validation & preprocessing
- Research-oriented data workflows

## Notes
This repository focuses on data logic and workflow design.
The original VR environments and experiment setup are not included.
